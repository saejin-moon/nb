    "\n",
    "*   **Confounding Variable:** A third variable that influences both the independent and the dependent variable. In the Chapter 8 medical trial, \"Sex\" was a confounder because it influenced who received the treatment and the inherent recovery rate.\n",
    "*   **Intermediate Variable (Mediator):** A variable that is the middle-man between the independent variable and the dependent variable. The independent variable causes the intermediate variable, which in turn causes the dependent variable. In the Chapter 8 agricultural trial, \"Height\" was intermediate because the plant variety determined the height, which determined the yield."
