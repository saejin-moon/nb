    "This result highlights the **first-mover advantage** inherent in Stackelberg competition. The first firm (the leader) gets to choose its output knowing how all subsequent firms will react. It maximizes its profit by choosing a large output, which reduces the residual demand remaining for the next firm. Firm 2, facing this smaller market, chooses a smaller optimal output. This logic continues down the line: each firm $i$ faces a smaller residual market than firm $i-1$ did, because the cumulative output of firms $1$ through $i-1$ is larger than the cumulative output of firms $1$ through $i-2$. This strategic commitment by early movers to a high output level effectively \"crowds out\" later movers, forcing them to produce less."
